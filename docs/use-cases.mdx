# Clinical Use Cases

MedAI focuses on turning unstructured clinical text into structured, usable data.
Below are the core scenarios supported by the platform.

## Clinical Entity Extraction

Extracts key entities such as diagnoses, medications, lab values, procedures, and
clinical findings from notes and reports. Results can be exported to downstream
systems or used for analytics.

## Note Processing and Normalization

Cleans and standardizes clinical notes by resolving abbreviations, mapping to
controlled vocabularies, and normalizing dates and measurements to consistent
formats.

## Cohort and Case Identification

Filters patients and encounters based on extracted entities and rules (e.g.,
specific diagnosis codes, medication exposure, or lab thresholds) to support
research and quality improvement.

## Summarization and Triage Support

Generates concise summaries or highlights for clinician review, helping prioritize
cases and surface critical information quickly.
